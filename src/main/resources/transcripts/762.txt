\[Megan stands by a TV set and addresses Cueball in the couch and his Cueball-like friend who sits in front of the TV on the floor.\]

Megan: While I'm up, does anyone want a sandwich?

Cueball: Is "sandwich" a metaphor?

\[A frame-less panel with the same scene, without the TV. Cueball has taken a hand to his chin and the friend on the floor looks down.\]

Megan: No, I'm bad at metaphors. But I could try a simile.

Cueball: I guess that's *like* a metaphor.

Cueball: Sure.

\[While Megan walks past them, Cueball leans forward and his friends looks back up at him as they continue to speak.\]

Friend: Well, "a simile is like a metaphor" is a simile.

Cueball: Is that simile itself a metaphor for something?

Friend: Maybe it's a metaphor for analogy.

\[Cueball and his friend are still sitting and talking while Megan replies from off-panel.\]

Cueball: Similes *are* like metaphors in that they're both analogies.

Megan (off-panel): Analogies are like sandwiches in that I'm making one now.
