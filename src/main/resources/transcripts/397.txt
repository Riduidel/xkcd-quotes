\[Cueball and Megan are sitting on a coach, watching Mythbusters.\]

TV: Can a ninja catch an arrow? On this episode, we'll find out!

Cueball: Mmm, science.

Megan: Hey, Mythbusters is entertaining, but it's not science.

Zombie Feynman: *BRAAAAAIIINNS*...

Cueball: Zombie Feynman!

Zombie Feynman: You got a problem with Mythbusters?

Megan: They fail at basic rigor!

Zombie Feynman: "Ideas are tested by experiment." That is the core of science. Everything else is bookkeeping.

Zombie Feynman: By teaching people to hold their beliefs up to experiment, *Mythbusters* is doing more to drag humanity out of the unscientific darkness than a thousand lessons in rigor. Show them some love.

Zombie Feynman: Anyway, back to zombie stuff. I hunger for *BRAAAAAIIINNS!*

Cueball: Uh, try the physics lab next door.

Zombie Feynman: I said brains. All they've got are string theorists.
