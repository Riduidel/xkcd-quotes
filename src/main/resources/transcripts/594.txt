\[Cueball is standing with a hand to his chin looking towards a woman off-panel right. In all panels the woman answers off-panel with a small starburst close to the right panels border indicating from where her speak emanates.\]

Woman's voice (off-panel): Ugh. Stupid uterus.

Cueball: Hey, your period is every 28 days, right?

\[Cueball is standing hands down.\]

Woman's voice (off-panel): Yes, why?

Cueball: Well, period = T = 1/f.

Woman's voice (off-panel): So?

\[Cueball holds up a finger in front of him.\]

Cueball: Using this, we can calculate something you already know.

Woman's voice (off-panel): What?

\[Cueball is standing hands down.\]

Cueball: Your uterus-hertz.

Woman's voice (off-panel): If I could get up I'd smack you.
