\[Two Cueball-like guys are playing basketball. The right guy (Cueball) attempts to throw the basketball through the hoop, but it bounces off down to his friend. To the right Black Hat has his back to the other two while he is looking at his phone.\]

Friend: Do you seriously think *everyone* will move to Plus? It was hard enough getting them on Facebook.

\[The friend has caught the rebound and now passes the basketball back to Cueball. Black Hat is not shown.\]

Cueball: Do they have to?

Cueball: My mom still uses AOL—it doesn't mean my social life has to happen there.

\[Only Cueball is shown. He passes the basketball to the right towards the off-pannel Black Hat.\]

Cueball: Universal adoption isn't everything. I mean, IRC is still—

\[Zoom in on the basketball as an arrow pierces the ball, forming a slight depression.\]

*Thunk*

\[Cueball looks to Black Hat who has a crossbow in one hand, he is still looking at the phone in his other hand. The ball with the arrow lies between them.\]

Cueball: You're not really the "catch" type, are you?

Black Hat: I am not.
