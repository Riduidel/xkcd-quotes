THE WORLD

According to a Group of

**AMERICANS**

who turned out to be unexpectedly good at geography, derailing our attempt to illustrate their country's attitude toward the rest of the world.

\[Left to right, up to down.\]

\[North of Canada.\] Hey so what projection should we use?

I'll aim for "Robinson."

\[North America.\] Alaska; Canada; Hudson Bay; Québec; United States

Did you know Maine is actually the US state closest to Africa?; Bermuda (British!)

\[Central America.\] Baja California (Mexico); Mexico; Central America; Panama Canal; Gulf of Mexico; Cuba; Hispañola; POR.; Jamaica

Do we have to label all the Virgin Islands?

\[South America.\] Rest of South America (spanish-speaking); Brazil (portugese-speaking); French, and I think Dutch and English; Tierra del Fuego

\[Greenland.\] Greenland (still too big!); Yeah but the Peters map is awful; Iceland

\[Europe.\] British Isles; Ireland; Gibralter; Scandanavia; Western Europe; Eastern Europe; Black sea; Middle East

\[Africa.\] Morocco; Algera; Sahara Desert; West Africa; Sudan; Rainforest DRC; Lake Victoria; Somalia; Angola; Mozambique; South Africa; Cape Horn; Madagascar

\[West of DRC.\] So this is one of those things where you point out our ignorance and stereotypes?

Yeah – I mean, I freely admit I don't know the African map very well, which speaks volumes in itself.

\[West Asia.\] Russia; Aral sea (Gone); Various former Soviet states; Afghanistan & Pakistan; India; Mostly Muslim; Mostly Hindu

\[Indian Ocea.\] Sri Lanka; Boxing Day Quake

Wait, "Boxing day"? There's no way you're American.

I read BBC News, OK?

\[East Asia.\] Mongolia; Tibet (contested); China; Southeast Asia

\[Pacific Ocean.\] Kamchatka Pennisula, but I admit I only know this one from Risk.

Koreas; Japan, duh.; Taiwan (actually called "The Republic of China." – it's complicated.); Phillipines; Malaysia; Indonesia; Sulawesi; Paupa New Guinea; Australia; Tasmania; New Zealand

\[South of Africa.\] Should we include Antarctica?

Let's not – these guys are looking impatient.
