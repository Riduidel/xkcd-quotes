\[Two men with beards stand at a crude wooden counter. One is wearing a turban. Behind the man without a turban is a woman kneeling on the ground and putting something into a box.\]

Turban man: Nine silvers for a ham? That's too much!

No-turban: Too much? There's a monk out back *with a ladder!*

Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha

Caption: There's no reason to think that people throughout history didn't have just as many inside jokes and catchphrases as any modern group of high-schoolers.
