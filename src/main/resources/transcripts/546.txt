\[Cueball sits at his computer.\]

Cueball \[typing\]: ...and that's why music DRM is bad for listeners *and* artists!

Megan \[off-panel\]: What are you doing?

\[Megan enters and Cueball turns towards her.\]

Megan: In case you didn't notice, we *won* the music DRM war. The big stores are DRM free.

\[Zoom in on Megan who holds up a hand doing the sign of the horns.\]

Megan: So close the comment thread, get out the debit card, buy us some music, and let's rock the fuck out.

\[Back to viewing both as in panel 2.\]

Cueball: But I don't actually *like* music, I just like being self-righteous on the web.

Megan: Lucky for you, *that* will always be free.
