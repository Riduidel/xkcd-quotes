\[Cueball at his computer calls out for Megan who comes walking in to the frame.\]

Cueball: I, um, messed up my server again.

Megan: I'll take a look. You have the *weirdest* tech problems

\[Zoom in on only Megan who uses the root prompt on the computer.\]

`~# ls`

\[Megan stands next to the computer, Cueball sits behind her on his chair. The computer returns the following:\]

`/usr/share/Adobe/doc/example/android_vm/root/sbin/ls.jar:`

`Error: Device is not responding.`

\[Megan turns towards Cueball who lifts his hands with palm up.\]

Megan: What did you *do!?*

Cueball: Maybe the device is busy. Should I try it later?

Megan: You should shut down this system and wait for the Singularity.
