Cueball: Check it out—a pocket microscope!

Megan: Ooh! Let's look at stuff!

Cueball: The tip of this pencil is *neat*.

Megan: This quarter is really scratched.

Cueball: Let's look at the skin under our fingernails!

\[Cueball and Megan curl up in a black pit of despair.\]

Cueball and Megan: oh god oh god
