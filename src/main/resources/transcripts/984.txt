\[Cueball, is holding something up to show it to Black Hat. It is small and rectangular with a black line in the middle (possible a rocket).\]

Cueball: Check out the SLS — 130 tons to orbit. Finally, rockets that improve on the ones we had 40 years ago.

Black Hat: Are we getting Nazis to build those ones, too?

\[Text is written between two frames, with two smaller frames below. A line comes up to Cueballs first comment, showing that it is still the two from the first frame talking, but off-panel.\]

Cueball (off-panel): What?

Black Hat (off-panel): When we first captured von Braun and his team, we had our engineers interview them, then *we* built the rockets.

Black Hat (off-panel): But our rockets kept exploding.

\[First small panel below the above text: A soldier with helmet and a machine gun is guarding von Braun who is tied to a chair, while being interviewed by an almost bald scientist (hair along the back of his head), who takes notes on a piece of paper.\]

\[Second small panel below the above text: The same scientist standing with the paper, watches as a launching rocket explodes. The landscape behind shows a hill.\]

\[A black frame with white text above the white Saturn V rocket flying through space.\]

Black Hat (off-panel): Eventually we gave up and had the German teams do it, and they built us the Saturn V Moon rocket.

\[Cueball is looking down, his hand with the thing he showed to Black Hat in the first panel hanging down. Black Hat looks at Cueball.\]

Cueball: I'm… not sure what lesson to take from that.

Black Hat: "If you want something done right, learning from the Nazis isn't enough. You have to actually put them in charge."

Cueball: That's a *terrible* lesson.

Black Hat: Then I guess you should get a Nazi to come up with a better one.
