Megan: ROB! ROB!

Rob: You look terrified! What's wrong?

Megan: We've made a huge mistake!

\[Both standing in place, Megan has hands up in an explaining gesture.\]

Megan: Remember last week when we dug up all those Indian bones and made puppets out of them?

Rob: Sure...

\[Megan is throwing her arms out.\]

Megan: It turns out they were buried over an *ancient Indian burial ground!*

Rob: Oh my God!
