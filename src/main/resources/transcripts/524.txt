Black Hat: And so I hired Rick Astley to show up at her party.

Cueball: And rickroll her? Isn't that a little...last year?

Black Hat: Ah, but he's not going to sing.

Danish: Hey is that Rick Astley?

Ponytail: I think it is. He just came in.

Danish: Oh no. Brace yourself.

Danish: Wait. He's just standing there. Where's the song?

Danish: He's staring at me.

Danish: This is a little creepy.

Danish: What's going on?

Danish: That's actually *Rick Astley* staring at me.

Danish: What's he doing?

Danish: Oh God, I keep expecting it, hearing it in my head.

\[Danish pulls at her hair.\]

Danish: Just do it already!

\[Danish runs off stage right.\]

Danish: Aaaaaaaa

\[Danish slams the door leaving Ponytail and Rick Astley\]

Door: Slam

Ponytail: Mr. Astley?

Rick Astley: Yes?

Ponytail: What did you *do* to her? What *was* that?

Rick Astley: That, my dear,

\[Rick Astley puts on sunglasses.\]

Rick Astley: Is how ***I*** roll.
