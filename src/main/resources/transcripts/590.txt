My Hobby:

Getting typography geeks heartfelt cards printed in "Papyrus" and watching them struggle to act grateful.

\[Ponytail is holding a card, with lines of indiscernible text, open and looking down, specifically neither on the card nor on Cueball, who is watching her instead. An angry tic is flicking on her forehead.\]

Ponytail: Thank you for the *\*twitch\** ... lovely... *\*twitch\** birthday card!
