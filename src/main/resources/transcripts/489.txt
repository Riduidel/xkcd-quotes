\[Cueball and Megan are talking while Cueball is walking away from Megan holding his hands up. Megan is holding a folded page of a letter up in one hand, the envelope can be seen behind the page, which only displays one line of visible but unreadable text.\]

Megan: I'm sorry. The Google Maps team hired me.

Cueball: But I can't move to California!

\[Megan has taken her hand down holding the letter so the backside of the envelope is now visible. Cueball turns towards her and holds one hand up in front of him self.\]

Megan: Then I guess this is the end.

Cueball: It can't be!

Cueball: Listen.

\[Cueball and Megan are holding each others hands with stretched out arms, looking into each others eyes. The envelope has disappeared from Megan's hands.\]

Cueball: When I look deep into your eyes, I see a future for us.

Megan: Look deeper.

\[In this frame-less panel Cueball takes a hand up to his chin while he bends his head very close to Megan's head, and she even leans a bit back. The letter and envelope has returned to her hand, after they went missing in the previous panel.\]

\[Cueball stands normally as does Megan with her letter.\]

Cueball: "We're sorry, but we don't have imagery at this zoom level"?

Cueball: They... They have you already.
