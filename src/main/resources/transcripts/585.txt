\[Ponytail faces two Cueball-like guys. All three are wearing goggles and lab-coats. Between them on a shelve stands a microscope and a beaker.\]

Ponytail: The tracking tag will record the shark's movement and habits.

\[The capsule is shown to float upward towards a water surface.\]

Ponytail (narrating): Then, it will pop free and float to the surface.

\[A coast is shown, with arrows directed from water to land. A small white circle on one of the arrows indicate the balloon.\]

Ponytail (narrating): We can't afford a recovery program, so the capsules will inflate helium balloons, drift over land,

\[The capsule is shown in close up. It has a caption on it.\]

Ponytail (narrating): And hopefully be found and mailed to us. Any questions?

Caption: If found please call

\[Ponytail is standing over a groggy shark on a boat, with water behind her and a coastline in the background. She attaches the tracking tag to the shark.\]

*Chunk*

\[The shark is dropped headfirst off the boat, into the water with a large splash.\]

*Sploosh*

Shark: !!!

\[The course of the shark is shown, weaving around islands.\]

\[The capsule is shown sticking out of the shark at the moment it is ready to pop free.\]

*Click*

\[The capsule remains attached to the shark.\]

\[The balloon starts to inflate, still attached to the shark and underwater.\]

*Hissss*

\[As the balloon inflates, it starts to pull the shark to the surface.\]

Shark: ??

\[The balloon breaks the surface, pulling the shark with it.\]

\[Science Girl with a black ponytail, eating an ice cream cone is standing together with Cueball to the right in an otherwise empty frame.\]

\[Two screaming scientists (A Cueball-like guy and Ponytail) runs past the two, who turns to look after them. The guy is holding the microscope and Ponytail the beaker from the first frame.\]

Scientists: Aaaaaaaa

\[A shark attached to a huge balloon floats past the girl and Cueball, it follows the scientists while snapping it's jaws.\]

Shark: *Chomp chomp*

\[After the shark is gone, Science Girl turns to Cueball.\]

Science Girl: Daddy?

Cueball: Yes?

Science Girl: I want to be a scientist.
