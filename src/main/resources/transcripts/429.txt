\[Cueball sits hugging his knees. From his head there goes three bubbles to a thought bubble.\]

Cueball: If only there were some way we could be together.

\[The comic fades into a thought bubble in shaded gray color. The bubble contains the next four panels.\]

\[Cueball and Megan are lounging on a bed he seems to be massaging her neck while she is lying down.\]

Megan: We're so lucky to have each other. How did it happen, anyway?

Cueball: I, uh... I don't remember.

\[Zoom in on Megan sitting up with her hands behind her. The bed is not drawn.\]

Megan: No, really, how did we get together? It's hard to imagine it happening.

Cueball (off-screen): It does strain the bounds of fantasy...

Megan: ...Fantasy? That's it!

\[Megan now stand up at the foot of the bed. Cueball sits with one hand around his knee and the other to his chin.\]

Megan: My God, it's the only explan-ation: We're objects in some transient fantasy. We'll be gone when it ends!

Cueball: We'll lose each other.

Megan: Oh God.

\[Megan leaps from the bed with a flaming torch. Cueball jumps after her on his knees with his hands in the air.\]

Megan: Well, I'm not going out quietly. I'm burning this fucking world.

Cueball: Burn the world!

Megan: Fire! Fire! Cleanse this hellish place—

\[The thought ends with three bubbles going down to Cueball who is now standing and scratching his head and again the comic is back to the normal black drawing style.\]

Cueball: ??
