\[Rob is working at a workbench. Future-Rob appears out of nowhere with a baseball bat.\]

Future-Rob: Hi, Rob.

Rob: Whoa, you're me!

\[Future-Rob holding the baseball bat, standing next to Rob.\]

Future-Rob: You're about to have an idea for a time machine.

Rob: I am?

\[In a frameless panel, Future-Rob hits Rob over the head with the baseball bat.\]

*WHAM*

\[Megan approaches Future-Rob working at the workbench, with Rob nowhere to be seen. The bloody baseball bat is stashed behind it.\]

Megan: Hey, Rob. What's up?

Future-Rob: Nothing.

This happens somewhere roughly once a month.
