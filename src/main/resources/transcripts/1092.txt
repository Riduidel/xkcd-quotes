\[Megan and Cueball standing outside their en-Phelps-ified swimming pool.\]

Cueball: Why is Michael Phelps in your backyard pool?

Megan: I don't know. He's been there all day. *Go home, Michael!*

Michael Phelps: Woo! 18 gold medals!

\[Megan and Cueball break out a pair of pool nets and unsuccessfully try to snag Phelps.\]

Cueball: Can you get him?

Megan: He's so ***fast***!

Phelps: Ha hah! Can't catch me!

*Splash splash*

\[Cueball heads off to fetch something.\]

\[Cueball returns with a hand truck full of Jello mix.\]

Phelps: Oh crap.
