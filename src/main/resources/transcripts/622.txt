\[Miss Lenhart teaching a class gestures with both hands up as Megan, sitting at the first desk on a stool, raises a hand and asks a question. Cueball sits at the desks behind her supporting his head in both hands with the elbows on the desk.\]

Megan: How do you know there are an infinite number of primes?

Miss Lenhart: I'll answer in haiku!

\[In a frame-less panel, Miss Lenhart lifts a hand up while answering. Both students sit upright on their stools.\]

Miss Lenhart: Top prime's divisors'

\[Miss Lenhart floats into the air with three lines beneath her legs. Cueball looks up. Megan does not change position.\]

Miss Lenhart: Product (plus one)'s factors are...?

\[Miss Lenhart flies over the students heads with a curved line behind her. Neither student look up. The bottom frame of the panel is a curving thought/dream bobble that goes through the middle of the panel at a height just below the desk tops. Two thought circles goes from Cueball's head down to this frame, and Cueball's thoughts are shown below outside of the panel - without any frame around.\]

Miss Lenhart: Q.E.D., bitches!

Cueball (thinking): Wow, after the 48-hour sleep-dep mark, lectures get *really* interesting.
