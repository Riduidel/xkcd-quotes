\[Megan is setting up a party. She is standing with a bottle in one hand looking at a snack table in front of her. Beret Guy stands behind her with both arms raised. Above and behind them there is a big banner with gray text.\]

Megan: Everything's ready...

Megan: Except we're out of ice.

Beret Guy: I'll get some!

Banner: Party!

\[Beret Guy is walking down the street past a building with a store window and sign. He is waring a large bag of ice over his shoulder. Danish is standing on the sidewalk up against the brick wall and calls to him.\]

Danish: Hey sexy. Where're you headed with all that ice?

Beret Guy: A party!

Danish: There's a *better* party up at my place.

Beret Guy: But I—

Danish: C'mon, one drink.

Sign: Save Mart

Bag: Ice

\[Zoom in on Beret Guy who rubs his eyes groggily, small bubbles floating up from his head. A caption is written above the image in a box that breaks the top frame of this panel:\]

The next morning...

Beret Guy: ...Ugh... Where am I?

Beret Guy: I was supposed to—

Beret Guy: —Where's all my ice!?

\[Beret Guy looks down to find himself in a bathtub full of kidneys. His scream extends on both sides of the panel, with only the five central A's in full view:\]

Beret Guy: ***AAAAAAA***
