Ponytail: Man, paleontology sucks these days.

Cueball: Why?

Ponytail: *Jurassic Park* came out 15 years ago.

Cueball: So?

Ponytail: Today's grad students got into dinosaurs after seeing it as kids. They don't care about fossils. Brats.

Ponytail: Before they had living dinosaurs handed to them by Hollywood, I was out in Texas digging up Arcocanthosaur teeth.

Cueball: So, you were into dinosaurs when they were still underground?

Ponytail: Exactly!
