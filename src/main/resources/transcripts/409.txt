Cueball: Check it out! An electric longboard!

Megan: Sweet!

\[Cueball riding longboard with Megan sitting onboard — people in background.\]

Longboard: *RRRR*

\[Megan turned around on longboard.\]

Megan: I feel like we're missing something...

Cueball: Yeah...

Longboard: *RRRR*

  


\[Cueball and Megan still on longboard, going up an incline.\]

Cueball: Skating uphill like this is amazing. Years of gliding downhill and pushing uphill, and now suddenly it's gliding both ways.

Longboard: *RRRRRRR*

Cueball: It's like going from C to Python. You don't realize how much time you were spending on the boring parts until you don't have to do them anymore.

Megan: But coding C or assembly makes you a better programmer. Maybe the boring parts build character.

\[Cueball and Megan on longboard.\]

Cueball: Yeah... but it depends how you want to spend your life. See, my philosophy is-

\[Longboard gets into an accident.\]

**WHAM**

\[Calvin and Hobbes laying down in the grass near the Cueball and Megan laying down on the grass - Calvin and Hobbes's wagon is on the path, as is the longboard - all characters seeing stars.\]
