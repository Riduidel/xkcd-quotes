It's easy to forget, as we heap awards on *The Social Network*,

That before there was Facebook, MySpace, or even Friendster...

One website dreamed bigger than them all.

\[Cueball and another are talking.\]

Cueball: People like doing stuff. So why not build a website that offers that?

Another: Offers what? What would I do there?

Cueball: Anything! The only limit is yourself!

\[Another scene. Hacker, wearing headphones and oblivious, working at computer. Cueball runs in to interrupt; Another holds him back.\]

Cueball: Hey, we need more—

Another: Don't–he's wired in.

Hacker: *The infinite is possible.*

Another: Or baked. It's hard to tell.

\[Cueball and another at table in bar.\]

Cueball: It's time to monetize. We could make millions!

Another: No way. A million dollars isn't cool. You know what's cool?

Cueball: A billio–

Another: *Circles.*

\[Long shot in bar. Drinks on table in foreground; dim figures in doorway in background; Cueball, alone, shouting into the distance.\]

Cueball: Hey–a tip: drop the dot.

Cueball: Just "Zombocom".

Cueball: It's cleaner.
