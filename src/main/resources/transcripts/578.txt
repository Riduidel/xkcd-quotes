\[Cueball with skateboard and gear and Megan are talking.\]

Cueball: "Why race him?" He's *Captain Reynolds!*

Megan: Mr. Fillion is an actor. Firefly was years ago.

\[They go over to a computer; Cueball is using a phone and presumably looking up a phone number.\]

Megan: He has his own life to live, and I'm sure the last thing he wants to do is indulge a fan by playing Mal for him.

Meanwhile...

\[Nathan Fillion is standing in front of a mirror in a trenchcoat.\]

Nathan: (into the mirror) Name's Captain Reynolds, ma'am. \*ahem\* Name's Captain Reynolds, ma'am.

Someone offpanel: Nathan? Telephone!

Nathan: That's *Captain!*

Someone offpanel: Fine, Captain Nathan.

Nathan: No, use my **space** name!

Someone offpanel: \*sigh\*

\[Nathan and Cueball talk on the phone.\]

Cueball: So, how about we race for charities?

Nathan: Sure. Always did want a charity of my own.

Cueball (between panels): Come again?

Nathan: You know, boxes in supermarkets collecting food. 'Course, ought to tack up a list sayin' which wines I like best...

Cueball: Uh, that's not quite—

Nathan (over the phone): Listen, I'm the captain here.

Cueball: ...I just got goosebumps when you said that.

Nathan: Yeah, happens to me too whenever I get captainy. I cut such a strapping figure.

Nathan: Buckle! Swash!

Nathan: All right, let's do this race.
