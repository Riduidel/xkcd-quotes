\[Nigel Tufnel of Spinal Tap is showing off his amplifier to Cueball.\]

Nigel: These amps go to 11.

Cueball: Is that louder?

Nigel: It's one louder.

Normal Person:

Cueball: Why not make 10 louder and make 10 the highest?

Engineer:

Cueball: But 11 doesn't have any units. It's an arbitrary scale mapping outputs—

Nigel: Zzzz

Smart Engineer:

Cueball: For $2,000 I'll build you one that goes to 12.
