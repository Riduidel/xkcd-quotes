\[An open wardrobe, with a boat anchor attached to one corner, falling towards water.\]

\[Below the water line a formula with its variables explained is shown:\]

Q = A \* sqrt(2 \* g \* d)

Q = flow rate

A = area of opening

d = ocean depth (2 km)

g = Earth gravity

\[And below the formula:\]

Flow: ~400,000 liters/ s

Water jet velocity: ~200 m/ s
