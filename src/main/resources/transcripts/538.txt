A Crypto nerd's imagination:

\[Cueball is holding a laptop, and his friend is examining it.\]

Cueball: His laptop's encrypted. Let's build a million-dollar cluster to crack it.

Friend: No good! It's 4096-bit RSA!

Cueball: Blast! Our evil plan is foiled!

What would actually happen:

\[Cueball is holding a piece of paper and giving his friend a wrench.\]

Cueball: His laptop's encrypted. Drug him and hit him with this $5 wrench until he tells us the password.

Friend : Got it.
