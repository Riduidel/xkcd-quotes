\[Cueball is standing behind a friend, who is sitting at a computer.\]

Cueball: Hey, will you be in town the day after Christmas?

Friend: Couldn't say—

Friend: I'm Jewish.

Cueball: But... how does being Jewish keep you from knowing your plans?

Friend: I know my plans—

Friend: I just don't know when Christmas is.

Cueball: Really? Why not look it up?

Friend: Well, I'm also a physicist.

Cueball: So?

Friend: I believe that since I don't observe Christmas, it can't *have* a definite date.
