\[Cueball is holding a pair of books and showing them to Megan.\]

Cueball: Man. Timothy Zahn, Michael A. Stackpole, The Corellian Trilogy...

Cueball: This was my world.

Megan: What'd you leave it for? Firefly? BSG?

Cueball: Nah.

Megan: Really.

Megan: So how's Ron Paul doing?

Cueball: Ooh! Lemme recheck today's blogs.

\[Cueball drops the books and heads off to recheck the blogs.\]
