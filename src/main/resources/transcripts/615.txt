\[Cueball is sitting in a chair holding a phone to his ear while his Cueball-like friend talks to him.\]

Friend: Did you call that hot girl from the party yet?

Cueball: I've been trying.

\[In a frame-less panel Cueball looks at his phone and talks to his friend.\]

Cueball: It's weird. I swear I got her the first time. But now it says the number's wrong.

\[Zoom in on the friend, Cueball talking to him off-panel.\]

Friend: What did you say she did, again?

Cueball (off-panel): Voice work. At Verizon, I think.

Cueball (off-panel): Why?

Friend: No reason.

\[Megan is talking into a phone, in an italic voice. Cueball's remark is shown emanating from the phone with a zig-zag line, also the click from hanging up the phone is shown like that.\]

Megan: *We're sorry, your call could not be completed as dialed.*

Cueball (over the phone): Damn.

*\*Click\**

Megan: *Please check the number and try again.*
