Connr: I'm Connr Clark, CTO at Eusocial Media Ventures.

Beret Guy: I'm a business professional! Earlier I photocopied a burrito!

\[Connr hands Beret Guy a business card. Beret Guy takes it and hands Connr another business card. Beret Guy has put his suitcase on the floor.\]

Connr: You should check us out! Here's my card.

Beret Guy: Here's mine! Networking!

\[Connr takes a closer look at the card, and Beret Guy holds up his case.\]

Connr: ...this just says "This is my business card!"

Beret Guy: Do you like it? I have more in my handlebox.

\[Beret Guy puts his case on a table and opens it to reveal it is full of cash. Connr looks on in shock.\]

Connr: Uh, that's ok, I think I'll—

Beret Guy: Here, have ten of them!

Connr: —holy shit that thing is full of *cash!*

\[Connr raises his arms in excitement. Beret Guy turns to face him and chews on Connr's business card.\]

Connr: Where did you *get* that?

Beret Guy: I am a business grown-up who makes business profits!

Connr: That's like a quarter of a million dollars!

Beret Guy: Yay! Business is fun! Do you have more of your cards? They're *delicious!*
