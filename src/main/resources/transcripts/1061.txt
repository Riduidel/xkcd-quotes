**Earth Standard Time**

(EST)

**A universal calendar for a universal planet**

EST is...

Simple • Clearly defined • Unambiguous

Free of historical baggage • Compatible with old units

Precisely synced with the solar cycle • Free of leap years

Intermittently amenable to date math

\[Inside the frame a list of the details concerning EST is shown:\]

Units

Second: 1 S.I. second

Minute: 60 seconds

Hour: 60 minutes

Day: 1444 minutes (24 hours 4 minutes)

Month: 30 days

Year: 12 months

Rules

For 4 hours after every full moon, run clocks backward.

The non-prime-numbered minutes of the first full non-reversed hour after a solstice or equinox happen twice.

\[In two columns the "Epoch" is put into a contrasting juxtaposition to "Time Zones":\]

Epoch

00:00:00 EST, January 1st, 1970 = 00:00:00 GMT, January 1st, 1970 (Julian Calendar)

Time Zones

The two EST time zones are *EST* and *EST (United Kingdom)*. These are the same except that the UK second is 0.9144 standard seconds.

\[A few further statements:\]

Daylight saving: Countries may enter DST, but no time may pass there.

Narnian Time: Synchronized✔

Year Zero: EST *does* have a year 0. (However, there is no 1958.)
