My Hobby:

Renting an SUV and confusing the hell out of hybrid owners

\[A Prius Driver is pumping gas into his car at a gas station. The prices can be seen in the background, and read:\]

$4.08

M: $4.38

P: $4.51

D: $4.85

\[Cueball drives up alongside in an SUV and leans out the window.\]

Cueball: Check out those prices! Your Prius ain't looking so smart *now*, huh?

Prius Driver: It's ... wait, what?

Cueball: Maybe you'll go green *next* time, asshole!
