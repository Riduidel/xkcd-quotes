Sigh. Just a few clouds.

\[The clouds develop into orange, to the left of the dot.\]

Whoa! Huge storm out of nowhere!

\[The orange becomes red, and the storm moves towards the dot.\]

It's *growing!* And headed right for me! *Awesome!*

\[The storm splits in half.\]

Hey! What's it...

\[The two halves of the storm pass by the dot.\]

Dammit! *Again?!*
