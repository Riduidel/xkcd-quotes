\[Cueball and Nathan Fillion are ready on the start line on their electric skateboards.\]

Voice off panel: On your mark...

Voice: Get set...

Nathan: Remember episode 11, when I got all naked in that desert?

Voice: Go!

\[Nathan speeds away leaving Cueball standing at the start line.\]

Voice: ...I said "Go."

Voice: Someone throw some water on him.

Cueball: Can't...get it...out of my head...

\[Nathan on walkie talkie, speeding on his skateboard.\]

Nathan: He's right behind me. Kaylee, I'm gonna try a Crazy Ivan.

Jewel \[on walkie talkie\] ( 579 shows Nathan's naming confusion): That doesn't make any sense, Nathan.

Nathan: Trust me.

Jewel: No, I mean it's not a skateboard maneuver. The concept doesn't even apply to this situation.

Nathan \[via walkie talkie\]: That's why it *just might work!*

Jewel: No, that's the *opposite* of true!

Nathan: On my mark, override the remote differential and throw her into a spin.

Jewel \[via walkie talkie\]: okay, but—

Nathan: Mark!

*WHAM*

\[Nathan lying injured on the ground next to his skateboard, Cueball cruises past.\]

*Whirrrrrrrr*

\[Nathan, trying to stand up.\]

Nathan: I'm down. Tell Summer "The chickens are in the hayloft. Plan Gamma is a go."

\[Nathan, one foot on skateboard, looking at walkie talkie.\]

*mumbling from walkie talkie*

Jewel: She says, "Plan gamma acknowledged. The meerkats are in the bag.

\[Summer Glau is walking off panel.\]

Jewel \[to walkee talkie\]: So we're good?

Nathan: Hard to tell with her. Do you see an actual bag of meerkats?

Jewel: No.

Nathan: Then we're probably good.

\[Cueball screeching to a halt as he sees Summer Glau.\]

Cueball: Oh! Hi, Miss Glau! I'd love to talk, but Nathan's back on his feet and catching up.

\[Summer grabs Cueball's arm.\]

*Grab*

Cueball: Wha—

\[Summer kicks Cueball in the face whilst pulling his arm towards her, he flies off his skateboard.\]

\[Summer walking away as Cueball lies crippled on the floor with his sunglasses beside him.\]

\[Cueball still lying on the floor.\]

Cueball \[thinking\]: I've never been so turned on in my life.
