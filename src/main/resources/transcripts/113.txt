You are like the prime numbers

Unpredictable turns, unconstrainable

Tantalizingly regular but never quite the same

I am like the Riemann-Zeta function

A rippled curtain of the imagined and real

Deeply tied with you in ways incomprehensible

Although, strictly speaking, The Riemann-Zeta function couldn't have given you herpes
