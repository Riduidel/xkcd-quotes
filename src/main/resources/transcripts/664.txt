\[Cueball sits at a desk in front of a computer, leaning back in his chair with both hands down to his side. There are cans on the desk and more crushed ones on the floor.\]

Cueball: I just wrote the most beautiful code of my life.

\[Curved lines with arrows divide the comic into two possible end panels, labeled "Academia" and "Business."\]

Academia:

Professor: My god... this will mean a half-dozen papers, a thesis or two, and a paragraph in every textbook on queuing theory!

Business:

Boss: You got the program to stop jamming up? Great. While you're fixing stuff, can you get Outlook to sync with our new phones?
