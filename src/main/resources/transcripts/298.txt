Black Hat: Cool, but—

\[Lightning shoots out of Black Hat's hands, Cueball appears to be in shock and awe.\]

Black Hat: Check this out!

\[The lights are back on, Cueball's arms are raised in amazement.\]

Cueball: How did you do that?

Black Hat: The world doesn't actually make any sense. Science doesn't work. No one told you because you're so cute when you get into something.

\[Black Hat floats up the frame, and Cueball is pointing towards Black Hat.\]

Black Hat: Still, neat toy.

Cueball: Now you're hovering!

Black Hat: I guess you're still not getting this.
