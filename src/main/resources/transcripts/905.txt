\[Cueball is in an empty room, on the phone with a friend.\]

Cueball: I've always rented, so this blows my mindâ€”this house is *mine*? I *own* a building?

Friend: Yup!

Cueball: I could, like, decide to drill a hole in that wall there, and nobody could do anything about it?

Friend: That's right!

\[Cueball, off the phone, stands in silence.\]

Ten hours later:

\[Cueball is standing to the left a pile of rubble, on the phone with a friend.\]

Cueball: Can I come stay with you? My house has a... problem.

Friend: Let me guess: you drilled holes in it until it collapsed?

Cueball: I don't think I'm cut out for homeownership.
