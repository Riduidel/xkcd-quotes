\[Black Hat and Cueball stand in front of a double door, which bears the label 'TIME door'. Black Hat has his hands on his hips.\]

Black Hat: I finished my time machine, but it's one-use-only.

Cueball: You *gotta* kill Hitler.

\[Close-up of Black Hat, one hand palm upward.\]

Black Hat: Why are you so obsessed with this Hitler guy? We have *all* of *time* we could explore!

\[Close-up of Cueball with both hands palm upward.\]

Cueball: He's evil incarnate! He murdered millions and sparked global war! *Everyone* agrees—if you get a time machine, you kill Hitler.

\[Black Hat enters the now open Time door as the other man looks on..\]

Black Hat: Fine, fine, I get it! Calm down. BRB, killing Hitler.

\[Black Hat returns, shutting the door with one hand. Cueball has outstretched arms.\]

Black Hat: There. Done. Are you happy?

Cueball: *Thank* you.

Black Hat: He was in some kind of bunker. 1945 was *loud!*

Cueball: ***NO!***
