Fun Fact: Stores have a competition to see who can spread your items across the most plastic shopping bags.

\[5 items placed in a single bag; heaviest item placed at the bottom.\]

Bag Packer: Here you go!

Shopper: Thanks!

\[Same items; heaviest item now placed in separate bag.\]

Bag Packer: Here you go!

Shopper: Oh, that's easier to carry.

\[Heavy item is now double bagged.\]

Bag Packer: Here you go!

Shopper: Double-bagging the big stuff makes sense...

\[The other 4 items are now split into 2 separate bags.\]

Bag Packer: Here you go!

Shopper: That's a bit wasteful...

\[The 2 separate bags are now double bagged.\]

Bag Packer: Here you go!

Shopper: You just put five items in six bags.

\[Every item is now in its own, double-bagged bag.\]

Bag Packer: Here you go!

Shopper: OK! I give up! I'll buy a reusable bag!

\[Reusable bag is double-bagged.\]

Bag Packer: Here you go!

Shopper: Augh!
