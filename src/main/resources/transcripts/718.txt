The Flake Equation:

P = W P × (C R \+ M I) × T K × F 0 × F 1 × D T × A U ≈ 100,000

Where:

W P = World Population (7,000,000,000)

C R = Fraction of people who imagine an alien encounter because they're crazy or want to feel special (1/10,000)

M I = Fraction of people who misinterpret a physical or physiological experience as an alien sighting (1/10,000)

T K = Probability that they'll tell someone (1/10)

F 0 = Average number of people they tell (10)

F 1 = Average number of people each friend tells this "firsthand" account (10)

D T = Probability that any details not fitting the narrative will be revised or forgotten in retelling (9/10)

A U = Fraction of people with the means and motivation to share the story with a wider audience (blogs, forums, reporters) (1/100)

Even with conservative guesses for the values of the variables, this suggests there must be a *huge* number of credible-sounding alien sightings out there, available to anyone who wants to believe!
