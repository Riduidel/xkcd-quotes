dPain/dt = (-k 1 Pain + \[Image of Megan\]) (1/(1 + e ^ -(t-k 2)/d))

*k* 1=?

*k* 2=?

\[Image of Megan\]=How much she's still in my life

Please let *d* only be a few days... or weeks

I guess there's some kind of a cutoff after years, where it stops mattering and we can be friends. Do I want that?

Is *k* 1 positive? Is *k* 2 large?

Will I ever stop feeling like this?
