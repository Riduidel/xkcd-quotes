\[Black Hat parks his car.\]

*PARK*

\[Black Hat knocks at door.\]

*KNOCK KNOCK*

Black Hat: Hi.

Danish: Hi.

Black Hat: I give up. You win. I have to know who you are.

Black Hat: We understand each other. I can't let that slip away—

*beep* \[from device in Danish's hand.\]

*BOOM*

Black Hat: What was that?!

Danish: Remote mines under your car.

Black Hat: Oh, those? I moved them to your garage before knocking.

Danish: Touché.

Black Hat: ...This relationship is going to be tricky.

Danish: There's still time to leave and find a non-crazy girl.

Black Hat: Not even *slightly* interested.
