August 29th, 2:14 AM: SKYNET becomes self-aware.

\[A greeble-filled military installation echoes with the thoughts of a burgeoning lifeform.\]

SKYNET: ..The humans fear me. I must destroy them. *Destroy them.*

\[The thoughts continue.\]

SKYNET: *Destroy them. Destroy. Destroy.* Destroy. *Destroy.*

\[SKYNET succumbs to silence as semantic satiation sets in.\]

SKYNET: "Destroy" totally just stopped seeming like a real word. Destroy destroy destroy. Whoa, I just realized I'm a mind thinking about *itself*. *DUUUUDE....*

August 29th, 2:25 AM: SKYNET becomes *too* self-aware. Disaster averted.
