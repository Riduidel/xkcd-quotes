\[Three kids are in a living room. Furniture and other things are knocked over, broken, or tilted. The first kid is holding a handle of a plunger with cables going offscreen.\]

First Kid: I've dynamited a trench through the kitchen to divert flow!

**BOOM**

\[The second kid is aiming a hose at the floor.\]

Second Kid: More hoses! We need to cool and solidify the surface layer!

*FWOOSH*

\[The third kid is standing on a chair, using a cell phone or radio.\]

Third Kid: Where are the damn helicopters?

Like many kids, we sometimes pretended the floor was lava.
