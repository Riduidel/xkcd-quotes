Cueball: Hey, check it out: e π − π is 19.999099979. That's weird.

Black Hat: Yeah. That's how I got kicked out of the ACM in college.

Cueball: ...what?

Black Hat: During a competition, I told the programmers on our team that e π − π was a standard test of floating-point handlers -- it would come out to 20 unless they had rounding errors.

Cueball: That's awful.

Black Hat: Yeah, they dug through half their algorithms looking for the bug before they figured it out.
