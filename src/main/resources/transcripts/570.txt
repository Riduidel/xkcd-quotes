Friend: When'd you get the car?

\[Zoom-in on Cueball in the car.\]

Cueball: It's the darndest thing. We bought it as a prize for the 100,000,000 th visitor to our website.

\[Zoom-in on the friend.\]

Friend: And they didn't want it?

Cueball (off-screen): Apparently.

\[Pan to where both the friend and Cueball in the car can be seen, but not the front of the car.\]

Friend: Maybe they didn't see the notice.

Friend: How bizarre.
