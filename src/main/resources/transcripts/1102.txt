\[A man with a combover, a book, and a clipboard approaches Black Hat.\]

Combover: You should check us out. We're the fastest-growing religion in the country.

Black Hat: "Fastest-growing" is such a dubious claim.

Combover: It's true! We grew by 85% over the past year.

\[Black Hat shouts to someone out of frame.\]

Black Hat: Hey, Rob — wanna join my religion?

Rob: Sure, whatever.

\[Black Hat turns back to Combover and produces a notepad and pen.\]

Black Hat: Well, looks like my religion grew by 100% this year.

\[Black Hat begins to walk away.\]

Combover: We have 38,000 members!

Black Hat: Hope they're all ok with second place.
