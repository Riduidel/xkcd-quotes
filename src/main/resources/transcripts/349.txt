\[Cueball is on the floor fiddling with the open tower in front of him. Megan is not shown in the panel but may be off-panel unless Cueball is talking to himself.\]

Label: 6 hours

Cueball: I'll be happy if I can get the system working like it was when I started.

Label: 10 hours

Cueball: Well, the desktop's a lost cause, but I think I can fix the problems the laptop's developed.
