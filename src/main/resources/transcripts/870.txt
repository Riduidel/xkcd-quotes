Mathematically Annoying Advertising:

A ∪ B = \{x:x ≤ 15 or x > 15\} = ℝ

\[line graph representing the above equation.\]

When discussing real numbers, it is impossible to get more vague than "up to 15% or more".

\[" **FREE!**\*" in large text, with substantial illegible fine print.\]

If someone has paid $x to have the word "free" typeset for you and N other people to read, their expected value for the money that will move from you to them is at least $(x / (N+1))

\[Graph representing inverse relationship between "amount you spend" on the y axis and "amount you save" on the x axis.\]

It would be difficult for the phrase "the more you spend the more you save" to be more wrong.
