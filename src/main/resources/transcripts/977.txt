What your favorite

**Map Projection**

says about you

\[All of these are organized as Title, a copy of the particular projection underneath, and what it says about you under that.\]

 *  Mercator
    
     *  You're not really into maps.
 *  Van der Grinten
    
     *  You're not a complicated person. You love the Mercator projection; you just wish it weren't square. The Earth's not a square, it's a circle. You like circles. Today is gonna be a good day!
 *  Robinson
    
     *  You have a comfortable pair of running shoes that you wear everywhere. You like coffee and enjoy The Beatles. You think the Robinson is the best-looking projection, hands down.
 *  Dymaxion
    
     *  You like Isaac Asimov, XML, and shoes with toes. You think the Segway got a bad rap. You own 3D goggles, which you use to view rotating models of better 3D goggles. You type in Dvorak.
 *  Winkel-Tripel
    
     *  National Geographic adopted the Winkel-Tripel in 1998, but you've been a W-T fan since *long* before "Nat Geo" showed up. You're worried it's getting played out, and are thinking of switching to the Kavrayskiy. You once left a party in disgust when a guest showed up wearing shoes with toes. Your favorite musical genre is "Post–".
 *  Goode Homolosine
    
     *  They say mapping the Earth on a 2D surface is like flattening an orange peel, which seems enough to you. You like easy solutions.You think we wouldn't have so many problems if we'd just elect *normal* people to Congress instead of Politicians. You think airlines should just buy food from the restaurants near the gates and serve *that* on board. You change your car's oil, but secretly wonder if you really *need* to.
 *  Hobo-Dyer
    
     *  You want to avoid cultural imperialism, but you've heard bad things about Gall-Peters. You're conflict-averse and buy organic. You use a recently-invented set of gender-neutral pronouns and think that what the world needs is a revolution in consciousness.
 *  Plate Carrée (Equirectangular)
    
     *  You think this one is fine. You like how X and Y map to latitude and longitude. The other projections overcomplicate things. You want me to stop asking about maps so you can enjoy dinner.
 *  A Globe!
    
     *  Yes, you're very clever.
 *  Waterman Butterfly
    
     *  Really? You know the Waterman? Have you seen the 1909 Cahill Map it's based— ...You have a framed reproduction at home?! Whoa. ...Listen, forget these questions. Are you doing anything tonight?
 *  Peirce Quincuncial
    
     *  You think that when we look at a map, what we really see is ourselves. After you first saw *Inception*, you sat silent in the theater for six hours. It freaks you out to realize that everyone around you has a skeleton inside them. You *have* really looked at your hands.
 *  Gall-Peters
    
     *  I *hate* you.
