Cueball (thinking): Why is chess so hard? Maybe the answers lie within me. Maybe I just need to let go, relax, and let my instincts and subconscious speak.

\[Cueball leans back and places his hands to his head.\]

*Meditate*

Cueball's subconscious: Knight to G-4

\[Beat panel.\]

Cueball: That's not even a legal move.

Cueball's subconscious: Okay, hold on. How do the pawns capture, again?

Cueball: Man, Obi-Wan was full of crap.
