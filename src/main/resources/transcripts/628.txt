\[Cueball is talking with Megan.\]

Cueball: I'm psychic, you know.

Megan: There's no such thing.

\[In a frame-less panel they continue to talk.\]

Cueball: Okay, think of a number from one to one hundred.

Megan: Okay.

Cueball: 43.

Megan: Holy shit!

\[Cueball lifts one hand towards Megan.\]

Cueball: I try not to let it affect my life too much.

Megan: Wait, I can't believe this.

\[Cueball turns and walks away, but stretches his arm back out towards Megan, who is still just standing looking after him.\]

Cueball: Don't worry about it. Forget I said anything.

Megan: But-

Cueball: Let's get to the movie.

Megan: I, uh... OK, sure.
