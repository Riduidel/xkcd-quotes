Because of a family illness, instead of regular comics, this week I'll be sharing some strips that I drew as part of a game I played with friends. Each comic had to be written and drawn in five minutes.

Comic \#1

\[A ninja is hiding under a diving board as a man runs along it.\]

\[The man jumps on the end of the board and hits the ninja in the head, knocking him into the pool.\]

\[The ninja floats in the water. A bullet passes through the man's head.\]

*thwipp*

\[The man is lying bleeding on the diving board, the ninja is still unconscious on the pool.\]

\[A sniper is at the top of a hill. The sign in front of the hill says "Grassy Knoll".\]

\[Someone is pointing at the diagram of the previous panel.\]

Off-panel voice: Wait, so *what* does this have to do with 9/11, again?

Cueball: I *said* I'm getting there!

Comic \#2

\[Cueball is studying Megan.\]

Cueball: You look different.

Cueball: You have this... glow about you.

\[They stare in silence.\]

\[A baby falls out of Megan.\]

*plop*

Comic \#3

Megan: Cogito ergo cogito.

Off-panel voice: Playing it safe, huh?

Comic \#4

\[Two children dressed up as ghosts are standing in front of Megan at a door, each carrying a bag.\]

Children: Trick or treat!

\[Megan doesn't move.\]

Child: Um hi. Why are you just standing there?

Other Child: Candy?

\[Another silent panel as the children stare up at Megan.\]

\[The second child looks in their bag.\]

Other Child: Oh God, my bag of candy.

Other Child: It's filling with blood.

Child: We should go.

Comic \#5

\[A jet is flying across the panel.\]

Pilot: Bail out! Bail out! Bail out!

\[The pilot and copilot have buckets, and are bailing water out of the cockpit.\]

Comic \#6

The following is a dramatization of real events.

\[Cueball is at a counter, with several jars.\]

Cueball: AAAAAAAAAAAAA I'm making a sandwich! AAAAAAAAAA!

Comic \#7

\[Two people are carrying lightsabers and wearing robes.\]

Cueball: Oh God, my eyes won't focus right! And your robe looks... really dirty!

My blacklightsaber was not a success.

Comic \#8

\[Cueball is standing.\]

Cueball: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

Off-screen voice: It seems we happen to be all ladies, actually.

Cueball: ...in that case, this defense is going to appear extremely ill-advised.

Comic \#9

\[Darth Vader is sitting between two people, at a table.\]

Cueball: Your sad devotion to that ancient religion hasn't helped you conjur up the stolen data tapes, or given you—

Darth Vader: *HEY.* Wicca is a legitimate belief system!

\[Darth Vader is drawing a pentagram on the table.\]

Cueball: What are you—

Darth Vader: Putting a hex on your family.
