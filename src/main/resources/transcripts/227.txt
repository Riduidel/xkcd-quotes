\[Cueball sits hunched over his desk, which is littered with objects. His Cueball-like friend holding his cell phone talks to him.\]

Friend: Hey, what's your cell number?

Cueball: (Violet Brown Gray)— Uh, I mean, (718)-387-6962.

Friend: Okay, you are putting down those resistors and going outside for a while.

Cueball: That's probably a good idea.
