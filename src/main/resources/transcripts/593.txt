\[Megan holding up book to Cueball.\]

Megan: This is the Voynich manuscript— a book, allegedly 500 years old, written in an unrecognized script. It's some kind of visual encyclopedia of imaginary plants and undeciphered "recipes".

\[Megan points while Cueball opens the book.\]

Megan: It could be a hoax, a lost language, a cipher, an alien text, glossolatia — no one knows.

Cueball: No one? But it's obvious.

\[Megan continues to talk. Cueball holds the now closed book.\]

Megan: ... Obvious? Linguists and cryptographers have been stumped for decades.

Cueball: They forget. Human nature doesn't change.

\[Close up of Megan and Cueball - the book is off panel.\]

Cueball: Just imagine someone found a book from our time, full of lists, illustrations, tables, and long, dry descriptions of nonexistent worlds written in an invented language. What have they found?

Megan: ...Dear Lord. It *is* obvious.
