\[Cueball and Hairy are standing next to a large pentagram with candles at the points. A figure is hovering above it in a wave of energy.\]

Hairy: You know, he could vanish at any moment.

Hairy: You should take this chance to make out with yourself.

Hairy: . . . You know, **I** could vanish at any moment.
