\[Cueball is standing in a bookstore, looking at a book.\]

Cueball thinking: This book looks interesting. Maybe I'll buy it.

\[Cueball reads the book; a clock appears above.\]

Cueball thinking: Oops, I read the whole thing.

Cueball thinking: I'll just quietly put it back and go.

\[Cueball walks through a security scanner to exit the bookstore.\]

*BEEP BEEP BEEP*

Voice from off-frame: Hey! Your brain set off the sensor!

Cueball: I, uhh...

Voice from off-frame: You have a book in there, don't you!

Cueball: Crap.
