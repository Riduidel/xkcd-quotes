\[Randall Munroe (drawn as Cueball) stands behind a lectern on a podium in front of a large conference audience (consisting of Cueball heads), with a poster hanging beside him.\]

Randall: My cryptosystem is like any Feistel cipher, except in the S-Boxes we simply take the bitstring down, flip it, and reverse it.

\[The poster reads:\]

Decryption

`01101010`

`>>`

`00110101`

\[inverter symbol\]

`11001010`

\[crossed arrows\]

`01010011`

\[Caption below the crowd:\]
