\[Cueball is singing into a microphone he is holding while Megan sit in her office chair typing on her computer. Musical notes fly around Cueball.\]

Cueball: It's the thigh of the tiger

\[Cueball continues to sing, titling his head upwards.\]

Cueball: When the moon hits your thigh like a big pizza pie, that's amore.

\[Cueball sings on now holding the microphone in both hands.\]

Cueball: She's my brown-thighed girl.

Megan: Don't you have a job or something?

Megan: Also, Eww.
