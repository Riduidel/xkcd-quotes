\[Cueball is sitting at a desk with a computer, typing.\]

Monitor: People try to shut us d-d-down

just 'cause our music gets around

\[Cueball is standing on his chair and typing with his keyboard across his hip.\]

Monitor: Old folks act like total noobs

\[Cueball is really wailing on the keyboard.\]

Monitor: Why don't you all just d-d-disconnect

and don't try an' grok our d-d-dialect

\[Cueball smashes the keyboard into the monitor.\]

I'm just bloggin' 'bout my generation
