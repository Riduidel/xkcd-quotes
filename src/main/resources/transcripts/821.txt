Because of a family illness, instead of regular comics, this week I'll be sharing some strips that I drew as part of a game I played with friends. Each comic had to be written and drawn in five minutes.

Comic \#1

Pearl Harbor. November 7th, 1941.

\[There is a beach, with some ships floating in a crescent shaped harbor.\]

\[The same bay, again.\]

\[The boats continue to move about the harbor.\]

\[The boats do their thing. A title explains.\]

(We're going to be here a while, since the attack wasn't until December.)

Comic \#2

\[Cueball is sitting on a bus, Megan in front of him.\]

I know it's natural and all, but I really wish women on the bus wouldn't try to breastfeed me.

Woman: C'mon, have some milk. Right here.

Me: I'm *reading*.

Instant persuasiveness multiplier!

Comic \#5

\[One person has a cord leaving their mouth, the other is holding a handset on the end of it to their ear.\]

Handset: Hee hee hee... \*giggle\*

I hear that if you drink coke and eat pop rocks, you vomit up a corded telephone handset on which you hear creepy little girls giggling.

Comic \#6

\[Three soldiers are holding a large integral sign, while a fourth points a gun at the Little Rock High School.\]

1957: Eisenhower orders the military to integrate Little Rock High School.

Comic \#7

\[A smartphone is vibrating across a table, towards a person.\]

The smartphones got *too* smart... and developed a taste... for BLOOD!

Fortunately, the only way they could move was by turning on their vibrate while on a sloped table.

Comic \#8

\[Cueball is reading to his child.\]

Cueball: And the wolf went to see the 38th little pig, who had built his house out of strontium.

Cueball: And the wolf was all, "Ok, what is *with* this shit?"

The 119 Little Pigs

Comic \#9

\[Cueball is holding up a gun.\]

Cueball: Fastest gun in the west!

\[The gun is galloping across the desert.\]

*gallop gallop*

\[There is a podium, with a gun in each position.\]

Winner!

Comic \#10

\[A picture of a centrifuge dominates the panel.\]

Centrifuges: They're what separate the men from the boys.

Comic \#11

\[A computer monitor is plugged in, and cables run into a wardrobe.\]

Lucy: Time passes differently in Narnia, so by putting the CPU and storage for my machine there, I was able to run through the \[email protected\] and \[email protected\] databases in about an hour.

Peter: There are so many problems with that.

Comic \#12

\[Someone is talking to Alice.\]

Person: One of these days, Alice... Wham, zoom, sploosh, fwoom, splash, gurlle, wheeeee, fwoosh, aren't waterslides fun?!
