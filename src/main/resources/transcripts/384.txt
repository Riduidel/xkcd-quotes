The Drake Equation:

N = R\* f p n e f l f i f c L B s

N: Number of communicating civilizations in our galaxy

n e: Number of life-supporting planets per solar system

f i: Probability that life on a planet becomes intelligent

B s: Amount of bullshit you're willing to buy from Frank Drake
