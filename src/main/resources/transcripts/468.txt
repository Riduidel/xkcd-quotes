Author Katharine Gates recently attempted to make a chart of all sexual fetishes.

Little did she know that Russell and Whitehead had already failed at this same task.

\[Russell, with long hair, and Whitehead are standing with Gödel (the last two are both Cueball-like), Russell holding a clipboard and smoking a pipe.

Gödel is holding his chin with his right hand as he ponders the question.\]

Russell: Hey, Gödel — we're compiling a comprehensive list of fetishes. What turns you on?

Gödel: Anything not on your list.

Russell: Uh…hm.
