\[Cueball sitting in an office chair at his workstation, with Ponytail standing behind him.\]

Cueball: I'm almost up to my old typing speed in Dvorak

\[Cueball is standing next to a server rack pointing at it while looking the other way at a Cueball-like guy. There are three sections filled with servers, two of them together, and space for several more above and below and betwen those two and the one at the bottom. Behind the rack wires comes down tot he floor from all three servers together and the wires then exits the panel to he right along the floor.\]

Cueball: Our servers now support Gopher.

Cueball: Just in case.

Megan: Our pages are now HTML, XHTML-Strict, and Haiku-compliant.

Cueball: Haiku?
