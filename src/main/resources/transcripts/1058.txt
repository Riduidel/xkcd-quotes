Man (typing): Whatever, noob. I've been on the internet since the BBS days.

Screen (reply from the noob): *Wrong.*

\[The noob turns out to be Science Girl, with two hair buns, who kneels on her chair, typing at a laptop on a table in this frame-less panel.\]

Science Girl (typing): Before I was born, a lab took egg and sperm samples from my parents and sequenced the DNA.

\[The man sits at his desk, reading his screen.\]

Screen (Science Girls writing): They emailed the genome to the Venter Institute, where they synthesized the genome and implanted it into sperm and eggs which became me.

\[Science Girl still typing on the laptop.\]

Science Girl (typing): So, no.

Science Girl (typing): You've ***looked*** at the internet.

Science Girl (typing): I've ***been*** there.
