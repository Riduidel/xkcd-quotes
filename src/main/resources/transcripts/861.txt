Cueball, on phone: Hey! Know how you've been bugging me to play Minecraft for the past year? I'm game.

Megan, on phone: But you said you didn't want to "get hooked and spend days on end moving virtual cubes around while sitting motionless." What changed?

Cueball, on phone: I'm having my wisdom teeth out, and I'll be useless and doped up on painkillers for the next few days, so that actually sounds like the perfect distraction.

Megan, on phone: Oh. I'll set you up on our server!

72 hours later...

\[Megan sitting at computer.\]

Megan, on phone: Hey — starting to feel better? Enjoying the game? Let's see what you've... What the hell? Where *IS* everything?

\[View of a Minecraft screen showing a vast empty expanse of land. In Cueball's hotbar is, from left to right, an stone pickaxe, sword, and shovel, seven feathers, 42 torches, a non-enchanted bow, a blank space, 64 blocks of stone and a clock. He has full health and 15 armor points.\]

Megan, offscreen: ...You made the entire continent perfectly flat?

Cueball, offscreen: And sorted it into layers.

Megan, offscreen: ...

Cueball, offscreen: I feel good about things. This is a good game.

\[Cueball sitting on the floor at his laptop, bleeding from the mouth, surrounded by bloody wadded-up tissues and holding a bottle of medication.\]

Megan, on phone: ...What exactly is in the painkillers they gave you?

Cueball, woozy: I can't read the label because I'm a hologram.
