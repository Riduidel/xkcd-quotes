\[Cueball and Megan stand outside a door into a laboratory (with the word "LAB" in large letters on the door). Cueball is leaning back against the door. A Cueball-like zombie which is clearly falling apart, walking with its hands stretched out in front of it, is visible through a window into the laboratory. At the top of the panel there is a frame around a yellow area with narration, which goes over the top of this panel's frame.\]

Narrator: The outbreak started with Patient Zero...

Cueball: He was exposed to toxin X-7— now he's a bloodthirsty monster!

Megan: Has he been in isolation?

Zombie: Braaains!

\[Cueball turns towards the door, pushing on it and partly blocking the door's label ("LA"). A noise indicates the zombie banging on the door from inside. Megan runs right her head and hand already partly outside the frame.\]

Cueball: Yes, but I can't hold this door for long!

Megan: Hang on, I've got a gun in my truck.

Zombie (hitting the door): *Wham*

\[In this frame-less panel Cueball opens the door a crack, leaning back with a hand in front of his face, as Megan shoots with her shotgun through the open door at the zombie inside. The word "LAB" on the door is no longer blocked.\]

Shotgun: *BLAM*

\[Cueball and Megan stand together away from the laboratory door. Megan still holds shotgun down. At the top and bottom of the panel there is two more frames around a yellow areas with narration, which goes over the top and bottom of this panel's frame. As Cueball and Megan talk, their names are revealed.\]

Narrator: And ended with Patient Zero five minutes later.

Cueball: So, I never got your name. I'm Ryan.

Megan: Laura.

Narrator: The remaining 90 minutes of the movie will be a romantic comedy.
