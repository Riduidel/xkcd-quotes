My Dearest Cordelia,

it has been far too long since I last gazed

upon your lithe and supple body through my

telescopic sights, and I fear you may have

found a superior vantage poin—

*BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!*

—a splendid effort, my love, but your shots

find only a decoy, and reveal your position atop

the maintenance shed.

I pray this missive and my grenades find you well.

War is hell.
