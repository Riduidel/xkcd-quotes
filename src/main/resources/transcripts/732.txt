\[Cueball is pointing to a huge flatscreen HDTV on the wall. His friend is holding a cell phone.\]

Cueball (HDTV Owner): Check out my new HDTV-a beautiful, high-def 1080p.

Friend: Wow, that's over *TWICE* the horizontal resolution of my cell phone.

Friend: In fact, it almost beats the LCD monitor I got in 2004.

It baffles me that people find HDTV impressive.
