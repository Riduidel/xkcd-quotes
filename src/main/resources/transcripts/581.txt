\[Nathan skates in.\]

Nathan: So you took care of him?

Summer: I can extrude hair, but I can't retract it.

Nathan: That a yes?

\[Summer grabs Nathan's arm as he skates past her, pulling him off the board.\]

Nathan: Bwah!

\[An Andy Capp-esque meleè dust cloud.\]

WHAP BAM POW WHAM

\[Summer skates away.\]

\[A beat-up Nathan approaches an similarly battered Cueball.\]

Nathan: She may have my board, but I can still beat you to the finish line if I bring you down.

Cueball: Bring it, Captain Tightpants.

Nathan: I've got nothing to bring. I just said that so she could get behind you.

\[Cueball turns.\]

Cueball: Who—

\[Cueball is hit with his board.\]

*WHAM*

\[Nathan stands over a prone Cueball.\]

Nathan: I just said *that* so *I* could get behind you. The serious fans always fall for the quotes.

Summer: I swallowed a bug again.

\[Close-up of Cueball's beaten face.\]

Cueball: All right, Fillion. I've had enough of your treachery and ...rugged good looks. This ends here.

\[Equally close-up: Nathan's face, bearing several grazes.\]

Nathan: All right, fanboy. Let this be our final battle.

\[They rush at each other, fists ready to swing punches.\]

Final battle canceled by Fox.
