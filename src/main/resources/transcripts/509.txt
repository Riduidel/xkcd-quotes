\[Beret Guy, extension cord in hand, approaches Cueball as he works at his computer.\]

Beret Guy: Can I plug my extension cord over here?

Cueball: No.

Beret Guy: Why?

Cueball: Solar Flares.

\[A diagram is displayed, illustrating the Earth's magnetic field being permanently impacted by a large solar flare (represented by a large arrow).\]

\[A second diagram is presented, illustrating the Earth's rotation and the resulting impact that the solar flare would have on the earth's magnetic field.\]

Cueball: A large solar flare could dent the Earth's magnetic field inwards. The Earth's spin could then induce a strong current in any long conductors, melting them and starting fires. By extending your cord, you could kill us all.

\[Stunned, Beret Guy looks down at the cord he carries.\]

Beret Guy: Really?

Cueball: Warn your friends.

\[Dejected, Beret Guy walks away, cord in tow.\]

\[Cueball looks up from his computer as he is braced by Megan, a stern look in her face.\]

Megan: That was mean.

Cueball: Listen, *somebody* has to keep Mythbusters in business. Next season should be fun.
