\[Cueball with a shotgun approaches a woman carrying a tray with glasses.\]

Cueball: Sarah! Come with me if you want to live! A robot assassin has been sent here to kill you!

\[Sarah holds her hands over her mouth. She has presumably dropped the tray, as it lies on the floor.\]

Cueball: I'm here to save you. I may not be as strong or fast as a machine, but I'll fight to keep you-

\[There's a huge orange and yellow explosion. The two are disintegrated and Cueball's shotgun goes flying.\]

*BOOM*

\[A flying robot assassin is above the bomb site.\]
