\[A formula is shown with the variables explained above:\]

P d Regional population density (e.g. 18,600/mi²)

X f Average person's frequency of sex (e.g. 80/year)

X d Average duration of sex (e.g. 30 minutes)

r=sqrt(2/(π\*P d\*X f\*X d))

On average, someone within distance r of you is having sex.
